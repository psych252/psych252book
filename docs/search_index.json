Some of the functions that I’ll introduce in this session are a little tricky to master. Like learning a new language, it takes some time to get fluent. However, it’s worth investing the time. ## Learning goals Learn how to group and summarize data using group_by() and summarize(). Learn how to deal with missing data entries NA. Get familiar with how to reshape data using pivot_longer(), pivot_wider(), separate() and unite(). Learn the basics of how to join multiple data frames with a focus on left_join(). Master how to read and save data. 5.1 Load packages Let’s first load the packages that we need for this chapter. library(&quot;knitr&quot;) # for rendering the RMarkdown file library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) # for data wrangling 5.2 Wrangling data (continued) 5.2.1 Summarizing data Let’s first load the starwars data set again: df.starwars = starwars A particularly powerful way of interating with data is by grouping and summarizing it. summarize() returns a single value for each summary that we ask for: df.starwars %&gt;% summarize(height_mean = mean(height, na.rm = T), height_max = max(height, na.rm = T), n = n()) ## # A tibble: 1 x 3 ## height_mean height_max n ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 174. 264 87 Here, I computed the mean height, the maximum height, and the total number of observations (using the function n()). Let’s say we wanted to get a quick sense for how tall starwars characters from different species are. To do that, we combine grouping with summarizing: df.starwars %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% summarize(height_mean = mean(height, na.rm = T)) ## # A tibble: 38 x 2 ## species height_mean ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Aleena 79 ## 2 Besalisk 198 ## 3 Cerean 198 ## 4 Chagrian 196 ## 5 Clawdite 168 ## 6 Droid 140 ## 7 Dug 112 ## 8 Ewok 88 ## 9 Geonosian 183 ## 10 Gungan 209. ## # … with 28 more rows I’ve first used group_by() to group our data frame by the different species, and then used summarize() to calculate the mean height of each species. It would also be useful to know how many observations there are in each group. df.starwars %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% summarize(height_mean = mean(height, na.rm = T), group_size = n()) %&gt;% arrange(desc(group_size)) ## # A tibble: 38 x 3 ## species height_mean group_size ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Human 177. 35 ## 2 Droid 140 5 ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; 160 5 ## 4 Gungan 209. 3 ## 5 Kaminoan 221 2 ## 6 Mirialan 168 2 ## 7 Twi&#39;lek 179 2 ## 8 Wookiee 231 2 ## 9 Zabrak 173 2 ## 10 Aleena 79 1 ## # … with 28 more rows Here, I’ve used the n() function to get the number of observations in each group, and then I’ve arranged the data frame according to group size in descending order. Note that n() always yields the number of observations in each group. If we don’t group the data, then we get the overall number of observations in our data frame (i.e. the number of rows). So, Humans are the largest group in our data frame, followed by Droids (who are considerably smaller) and Gungans (who would make for good Basketball players). Sometimes group_by() is also useful without summarizing the data. For example, we often want to z-score (i.e. normalize) data on the level of individual participants. To do so, we first group the data on the level of participants, and then use mutate() to scale the data. Here is an example: # first let&#39;s generate some random data df.summarize = tibble( participant = rep(1:3, each = 5), judgment = sample(0:100, size = 15, replace = TRUE)) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 15 x 2 ## participant judgment ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 45 ## 2 1 60 ## 3 1 24 ## 4 1 5 ## 5 1 100 ## 6 2 82 ## 7 2 93 ## 8 2 7 ## 9 2 21 ## 10 2 66 ## 11 3 19 ## 12 3 96 ## 13 3 20 ## 14 3 17 ## 15 3 61 df.summarize %&gt;% group_by(participant) %&gt;% # group by participants mutate(judgment_zscored = scale(judgment)) %&gt;% # z-score data of individual participants ungroup() %&gt;% # ungroup the data frame head(n = 10) # print the top 10 rows ## # A tibble: 10 x 3 ## participant judgment judgment_zscored ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 45 -0.0496 ## 2 1 60 0.363 ## 3 1 24 -0.628 ## 4 1 5 -1.15 ## 5 1 100 1.47 ## 6 2 82 0.744 ## 7 2 93 1.03 ## 8 2 7 -1.23 ## 9 2 21 -0.865 ## 10 2 66 0.322 First, I’ve generated some random data using the repeat function rep() for making a participant column, and the sample() function to randomly choose values from a range between 0 and 100 with replacement. (We will learn more about these functions later when we look into how to simulate data.) I’ve then grouped the data by participant, and used the scale function to z-score the data. TIP: Don’t forget to ungroup() your data frame. Otherwise, any subsequent operations are applied per group. Sometimes, I want to run operations on each row, rather than per column. For example, let’s say that I wanted each character’s average combined height and mass. Let’s see first what doesn’t work: df.starwars %&gt;% mutate(mean_height_mass = mean(c(height, mass), na.rm = T)) %&gt;% select(name, height, mass, mean_height_mass) ## # A tibble: 87 x 4 ## name height mass mean_height_mass ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker 172 77 142. ## 2 C-3PO 167 75 142. ## 3 R2-D2 96 32 142. ## 4 Darth Vader 202 136 142. ## 5 Leia Organa 150 49 142. ## 6 Owen Lars 178 120 142. ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars 165 75 142. ## 8 R5-D4 97 32 142. ## 9 Biggs Darklighter 183 84 142. ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi 182 77 142. ## # … with 77 more rows Note that all the values are the same. The value shown here is just the mean of all the values in height and mass. df.starwars %&gt;% select(height, mass) %&gt;% unlist() %&gt;% # turns the data frame into a vector mean(na.rm = T) ## [1] 141.8886 To get the mean by row, we can either spell out the arithmetic df.starwars %&gt;% mutate(mean_height_mass = (height + mass) / 2) %&gt;% # here, I&#39;ve replaced the mean() function select(name, height, mass, mean_height_mass) ## # A tibble: 87 x 4 ## name height mass mean_height_mass ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker 172 77 124. ## 2 C-3PO 167 75 121 ## 3 R2-D2 96 32 64 ## 4 Darth Vader 202 136 169 ## 5 Leia Organa 150 49 99.5 ## 6 Owen Lars 178 120 149 ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars 165 75 120 ## 8 R5-D4 97 32 64.5 ## 9 Biggs Darklighter 183 84 134. ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi 182 77 130. ## # … with 77 more rows or use the rowwise() helper function which is like group_by() but treats each row like a group: df.starwars %&gt;% rowwise() %&gt;% # now, each row is treated like a separate group mutate(mean_height_mass = mean(c(height, mass), na.rm = T)) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% select(name, height, mass, mean_height_mass) ## # A tibble: 87 x 4 ## name height mass mean_height_mass ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker 172 77 124. ## 2 C-3PO 167 75 121 ## 3 R2-D2 96 32 64 ## 4 Darth Vader 202 136 169 ## 5 Leia Organa 150 49 99.5 ## 6 Owen Lars 178 120 149 ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars 165 75 120 ## 8 R5-D4 97 32 64.5 ## 9 Biggs Darklighter 183 84 134. ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi 182 77 130. ## # … with 77 more rows 5.2.1.1 Practice 1 Find out what the average height and mass (as well as the standard deviation) is from different species in different homeworlds. Why is the standard deviation NA for many groups? # write your code here Who is the tallest member of each species? What eye color do they have? The top_n() function or the row_number() function (in combination with filter()) will be useful here. # write your code here 5.2.2 Reshaping data We want our data frames to be tidy. What’s tidy? Each variable must have its own column. Each observation must have its own row. Each value must have its own cell. For more information on tidy data frames see the Tidy data chapter in Hadley Wickham’s R for Data Science book. “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” –– Leo Tolstoy “Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” –– Hadley Wickham 5.2.2.1 pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() Let’s first generate a data set that is not tidy. # construct data frame df.reshape = tibble(participant = c(1, 2), observation_1 = c(10, 25), observation_2 = c(100, 63), observation_3 = c(24, 45)) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## participant observation_1 observation_2 observation_3 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 10 100 24 ## 2 2 25 63 45 Here, I’ve generated data from two participants with three observations. This data frame is not tidy since each row contains more than a single observation. Data frames that have one row per participant but many observations are called wide data frames. We can make it tidy using the pivot_longer() function. df.reshape.long = df.reshape %&gt;% pivot_longer(names_to = &quot;index&quot;, values_to = &quot;rating&quot;, cols = -participant) %&gt;% arrange(participant) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## participant index rating ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 observation_1 10 ## 2 1 observation_2 100 ## 3 1 observation_3 24 ## 4 2 observation_1 25 ## 5 2 observation_2 63 ## 6 2 observation_3 45 df.reshape.long now contains one observation in each row. Data frames with one row per observation are called long data frames. The pivot_longer() function takes at least four arguments: the data which I’ve passed to it via the pipe %&gt;% a names_to argument which specifies the name of the column which will contain the column names of the original data frame a values_to argument which specifies the name of the column which will contain the values that were spread across different columns in the original data frame a specification for which columns we want to gather – here I’ve specified that we want to gather the values from all columns except the participant column pivot_wider() is the counterpart of pivot_longer(). We can use it to go from a data frame that is in long format, to a data frame in wide format, like so: df.reshape.wide = df.reshape.long %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = index, values_from = rating) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## participant observation_1 observation_2 observation_3 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 10 100 24 ## 2 2 25 63 45 For my data, I often have a wide data frame that contains demographic information about participants, and a long data frame that contains participants’ responses in the experiment. In Section 5.2.3, we will learn how to combine information from multiple data frames (with potentially different formats). Here is a more advanced example that involves reshaping a data frame. Let’s consider the following data frame to start with: # construct data frame df.reshape2 = tibble(participant = c(1, 2), stimulus_1 = c(&quot;flower&quot;, &quot;car&quot;), observation_1 = c(10, 25), stimulus_2 = c(&quot;house&quot;, &quot;flower&quot;), observation_2 = c(100, 63), stimulus_3 = c(&quot;car&quot;, &quot;house&quot;), observation_3 = c(24, 45)) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 x 7 ## participant stimulus_1 observation_1 stimulus_2 observation_2 stimulus_3 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 flower 10 house 100 car ## 2 2 car 25 flower 63 house ## # … with 1 more variable: observation_3 &lt;dbl&gt; The data frame contains in each row: which stimuli a participant saw, and what rating she gave. The participants saw a picture of a flower, car, and house, and rated how much they liked the picture on a scale from 0 to 100. The order at which the pictures were presented was randomized between participants. I will use a combination of pivot_longer(), and pivot_wider() to turn this into a data frame in long format. df.reshape2 %&gt;% pivot_longer(names_to = c(&quot;index&quot;, &quot;order&quot;), names_sep = &quot;_&quot;, values_to = &quot;rating&quot;, values_ptypes = list(rating = &quot;character&quot;), cols = -participant) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = &quot;index&quot;, values_from = &quot;rating&quot;) %&gt;% mutate_at(.vars = vars(order, observation), .funs = ~ as.numeric(.)) %&gt;% select(participant, order, stimulus, rating = observation) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## participant order stimulus rating ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 1 flower 10 ## 2 1 2 house 100 ## 3 1 3 car 24 ## 4 2 1 car 25 ## 5 2 2 flower 63 ## 6 2 3 house 45 Voilà! Getting the desired data frame involved a few new tricks. Let’s take it step by step. First, I use pivot_longer() to make a long table. df.reshape2 %&gt;% pivot_longer(names_to = c(&quot;index&quot;, &quot;order&quot;), names_sep = &quot;_&quot;, values_to = &quot;rating&quot;, values_ptypes = list(rating = &quot;character&quot;), cols = -participant) ## # A tibble: 12 x 4 ## participant index order rating ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 stimulus 1 flower ## 2 1 observation 1 10 ## 3 1 stimulus 2 house ## 4 1 observation 2 100 ## 5 1 stimulus 3 car ## 6 1 observation 3 24 ## 7 2 stimulus 1 car ## 8 2 observation 1 25 ## 9 2 stimulus 2 flower ## 10 2 observation 2 63 ## 11 2 stimulus 3 house ## 12 2 observation 3 45 Notice how I’ve used a combination of the names_to = and names_sep = arguments to create two columns. Because I’m combining data of two different types (“character” and “numeric”), I needed to specify what I want the resulting data type to be via the values_ptypes = argument. I would like to have the information about the stimulus and the observation in the same row. That is, I want to see what rating a participant gave to the flower stimulus, for example. To get there, I can use the pivot_wider() function to make a separate column for each entry in index that contains the values in rating. df.reshape2 %&gt;% pivot_longer(names_to = c(&quot;index&quot;, &quot;order&quot;), names_sep = &quot;_&quot;, values_to = &quot;rating&quot;, values_ptypes = list(rating = &quot;character&quot;), cols = -participant) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = &quot;index&quot;, values_from = &quot;rating&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## participant order stimulus observation ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 1 flower 10 ## 2 1 2 house 100 ## 3 1 3 car 24 ## 4 2 1 car 25 ## 5 2 2 flower 63 ## 6 2 3 house 45 That’s pretty much it. Now, each row contains information about the order in which a stimulus was presented, what the stimulus was, and the judgment that a participant made in this trial. df.reshape2 %&gt;% pivot_longer(names_to = c(&quot;index&quot;, &quot;order&quot;), names_sep = &quot;_&quot;, values_to = &quot;rating&quot;, values_ptypes = list(rating = &quot;character&quot;), cols = -participant) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = &quot;index&quot;, values_from = &quot;rating&quot;) %&gt;% mutate_at(.vars = vars(order, observation), .funs = ~ as.numeric(.)) %&gt;% select(participant, order, stimulus, rating = observation) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## participant order stimulus rating ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 1 flower 10 ## 2 1 2 house 100 ## 3 1 3 car 24 ## 4 2 1 car 25 ## 5 2 2 flower 63 ## 6 2 3 house 45 The rest is familiar. I’ve used mutate_at() to turn order and observation into numeric columns, select() to change the order of the columns (and renamed the observation column to rating along the way). Getting familiar with pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() takes some time plus trial and error. So don’t be discouraged if you don’t get what you want straight away. Once you’ve mastered these functions, they will make it much easier to beat your data frames into shape. After having done some transformations like this, it’s worth checking that nothing went wrong. I often compare a few values in the transformed and original data frame to make sure everything is legit. When reading older code, you will often see gather() (instead of pivot_longer()), and spread() (instead of pivot_wider()). gather and spread are not developed anymore now, and their newer counterparts have additional functionality that comes in handy. 5.2.2.2 separate() and unite() Sometimes, we want to separate one column into multiple columns. For example, we could have achieved the same result we did above slightly differently, like so: df.reshape2 %&gt;% pivot_longer(names_to = &quot;index&quot;, values_to = &quot;rating&quot;, values_ptypes = list(rating = &quot;numeric&quot;), cols = -participant) %&gt;% separate(col = index, into = c(&quot;index&quot;, &quot;order&quot;), sep = &quot;_&quot;) ## # A tibble: 12 x 4 ## participant index order rating ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 stimulus 1 flower ## 2 1 observation 1 10 ## 3 1 stimulus 2 house ## 4 1 observation 2 100 ## 5 1 stimulus 3 car ## 6 1 observation 3 24 ## 7 2 stimulus 1 car ## 8 2 observation 1 25 ## 9 2 stimulus 2 flower ## 10 2 observation 2 63 ## 11 2 stimulus 3 house ## 12 2 observation 3 45 Here, I’ve used the separate() function to separate the original index column into two columns. The separate() function takes four arguments: the data which I’ve passed to it via the pipe %&gt;% the name of the column col which we want to separate the names of the columns into into which we want to separate the original column the separator sep that we want to use to split the columns. Note, like pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(), there is a partner for separate(), too. It’s called unite() and it allows you to combine several columns into one, like so: tibble(index = c(&quot;flower&quot;, &quot;observation&quot;), order = c(1, 2)) %&gt;% unite(&quot;combined&quot;, index, order) ## # A tibble: 2 x 1 ## combined ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 flower_1 ## 2 observation_2 Sometimes, we may have a data frame where data is recorded in a long string. df.reshape3 = tibble(participant = 1:2, judgments = c(&quot;10, 4, 12, 15&quot;, &quot;3, 4&quot;)) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## participant judgments ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 10, 4, 12, 15 ## 2 2 3, 4 Here, I’ve created a data frame with data from two participants. For whatever reason, we have four judgments from participant 1 and only two judgments from participant 2 (data is often messy in real life, too!). We can use the separate_rows() function to turn this into a tidy data frame in long format. df.reshape3 %&gt;% separate_rows(judgments) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## participant judgments ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 10 ## 2 1 4 ## 3 1 12 ## 4 1 15 ## 5 2 3 ## 6 2 4 5.2.2.3 Practice 2 Load this data frame first. df.practice2 = tibble(participant = 1:10, initial = c(&quot;AR&quot;, &quot;FA&quot;, &quot;IR&quot;, &quot;NC&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;PI&quot;, &quot;DH&quot;, &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;WT&quot;, &quot;JD&quot;), judgment_1 = c(12, 13, 1, 14, 5, 6, 12, 41, 100, 33), judgment_2 = c(2, 20, 10, 89, 94, 27, 29, 19, 57, 74), judgment_3 = c(2, 20, 10, 89, 94, 27, 29, 19, 57, 74)) Make the df.practice2 data framey tidy (by turning into a long format). Compute the z-score of each participants’ judgments (using the scale() function). Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each participants’ z-scored judgments. Notice anything interesting? Think about what z-scoring does … # write your code here 5.2.3 Joining multiple data frames It’s nice to have all the information we need in a single, tidy data frame. We have learned above how to go from a single untidy data frame to a tidy one. However, often our situation to start off with is even worse. The information we need sits in several, messy data frames. For example, we may have one data frame df.stimuli with information about each stimulus, and then have another data frame with participants’ responses df.responses that only contains a stimulus index but no other infromation about the stimuli. set.seed(1) # setting random seed to make this example reproducible # data frame with stimulus information df.stimuli = tibble(index = 1:5, height = c(2, 3, 1, 4, 5), width = c(4, 5, 2, 3, 1), n_dots = c(12, 15, 5, 13, 7), color = c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;black&quot;)) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 5 x 5 ## index height width n_dots color ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 2 4 12 green ## 2 2 3 5 15 blue ## 3 3 1 2 5 white ## 4 4 4 3 13 red ## 5 5 5 1 7 black # data frame with participants&#39; responses df.responses = tibble(participant = rep(1:3, each = 5), index = rep(1:5, 3), response = sample(0:100, size = 15, replace = TRUE)) %&gt;% # randomly sample 15 values from 0 to 100 print() ## # A tibble: 15 x 3 ## participant index response ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 1 67 ## 2 1 2 38 ## 3 1 3 0 ## 4 1 4 33 ## 5 1 5 86 ## 6 2 1 42 ## 7 2 2 13 ## 8 2 3 81 ## 9 2 4 58 ## 10 2 5 50 ## 11 3 1 96 ## 12 3 2 84 ## 13 3 3 20 ## 14 3 4 53 ## 15 3 5 73 The df.stimuli data frame contains an index, information about the height, and width, as well as the number of dots, and their color. Let’s imagine that participants had to judge how much they liked each image from a scale of 0 (“not liking this dot pattern at all”) to 100 (“super thrilled about this dot pattern”). Let’s say that I now wanted to know what participants’ average response for the differently colored dot patterns are. Here is how I would do this: df.responses %&gt;% left_join(df.stimuli %&gt;% select(index, color), by = &quot;index&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(color) %&gt;% summarize(response_mean = mean(response)) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## color response_mean ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 black 69.7 ## 2 blue 45 ## 3 green 68.3 ## 4 red 48 ## 5 white 33.7 Let’s take it step by step. The key here is to add the information from the df.stimuli data frame to the df.responses data frame. df.responses %&gt;% left_join(df.stimuli %&gt;% select(index, color), by = &quot;index&quot;) ## # A tibble: 15 x 4 ## participant index response color ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 1 67 green ## 2 1 2 38 blue ## 3 1 3 0 white ## 4 1 4 33 red ## 5 1 5 86 black ## 6 2 1 42 green ## 7 2 2 13 blue ## 8 2 3 81 white ## 9 2 4 58 red ## 10 2 5 50 black ## 11 3 1 96 green ## 12 3 2 84 blue ## 13 3 3 20 white ## 14 3 4 53 red ## 15 3 5 73 black I’ve joined the df.stimuli table in which I’ve only selected the index and color column, with the df.responses table, and specified the index column as the one by which the tables should be joined. This is the only column that both of the data frames have in common. To specify multiple columns by which we would like to join tables, we specify the by argument as follows: by = c(\"one_column\", \"another_column\"). Sometimes, the tables I want to join don’t have any column names in common. In that case, we can tell the left_join() function which column pair(s) should be used for joining. df.responses %&gt;% rename(stimuli = index) %&gt;% # I&#39;ve renamed the index column to stimuli left_join(df.stimuli %&gt;% select(index, color), by = c(&quot;stimuli&quot; = &quot;index&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 15 x 4 ## participant stimuli response color ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 1 67 green ## 2 1 2 38 blue ## 3 1 3 0 white ## 4 1 4 33 red ## 5 1 5 86 black ## 6 2 1 42 green ## 7 2 2 13 blue ## 8 2 3 81 white ## 9 2 4 58 red ## 10 2 5 50 black ## 11 3 1 96 green ## 12 3 2 84 blue ## 13 3 3 20 white ## 14 3 4 53 red ## 15 3 5 73 black Here, I’ve first renamed the index column (to create the problem) and then used the by = c(\"stimuli\" = \"index\") construction (to solve the problem). In my experience, it often takes a little bit of playing around to make sure that the data frames were joined as intended. One very good indicator is the row number of the initial data frame, and the joined one. For a left_join(), most of the time, we want the row number of the original data frame (“the one on the left”) and the joined data frame to be the same. If the row number changed, something probably went wrong. Take a look at the join help file to see other operations for combining two or more data frames into one (make sure to look at the one from the dplyr package). 5.2.3.1 Practice 3 Load these three data frames first: set.seed(1) df.judgments = tibble(participant = rep(1:3, each = 5), stimulus = rep(c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), 5), judgment = sample(0:100, size = 15, replace = T)) df.information = tibble(number = seq(from = 0, to = 100, length.out = 5), color = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;white&quot;)) Create a new data frame called df.join that combines the information from both df.judgments and df.information. Note that column with the colors is called stimulus in df.judgments and color in df.information. At the end, you want a data frame that contains the following columns: participant, stimulus, number, and judgment. # write your code here 5.2.4 Dealing with missing data There are two ways for data to be missing. implicit: data is not present in the table explicit: data is flagged with NA We can check for explicit missing values using the is.na() function like so: tmp.na = c(1, 2, NA, 3) is.na(tmp.na) ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE I’ve first created a vector tmp.na with a missing value at index 3. Calling the is.na() function on this vector yields a logical vector with FALSE for each value that is not missing, and TRUE for each missing value. Let’s say that we have a data frame with missing values and that we want to replace those missing values with something else. Let’s first create a data frame with missing values. df.missing = tibble(x = c(1, 2, NA), y = c(&quot;a&quot;, NA, &quot;b&quot;)) print(df.missing) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## x y ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 a ## 2 2 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 NA b We can use the replace_na() function to replace the missing values with something else. df.missing %&gt;% mutate(x = replace_na(x, replace = 0), y = replace_na(y, replace = &quot;unknown&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## x y ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 a ## 2 2 unknown ## 3 0 b We can also remove rows with missing values using the drop_na() function. df.missing %&gt;% drop_na() ## # A tibble: 1 x 2 ## x y ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 a If we only want to drop values from specific columns, we can specify these columns within the drop_na() function call. So, if we only want to drop rows that have missing values in the x column, we can write: df.missing %&gt;% drop_na(x) ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## x y ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 a ## 2 2 &lt;NA&gt; To make the distinction between implicit and explicit missing values more concrete, let’s consider the following example (taken from here): df.stocks = tibble(year = c(2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016), qtr = c( 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4), return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.35, NA, 0.92, 0.17, 2.66)) There are two missing values in this dataset: The return for the fourth quarter of 2015 is explicitly missing, because the cell where its value should be instead contains NA. The return for the first quarter of 2016 is implicitly missing, because it simply does not appear in the dataset. We can use the complete() function to make implicit missing values explicit: df.stocks %&gt;% complete(year, qtr) ## # A tibble: 8 x 3 ## year qtr return ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2015 1 1.88 ## 2 2015 2 0.59 ## 3 2015 3 0.35 ## 4 2015 4 NA ## 5 2016 1 NA ## 6 2016 2 0.92 ## 7 2016 3 0.17 ## 8 2016 4 2.66 Note how now, the data frame contains an additional row in which year = 2016, qtr = 1 and return = NA even though we didn’t originally specify this. We can also directly tell the complete() function to replace the NA values via passing a list to its fill argument like so: df.stocks %&gt;% complete(year, qtr, fill = list(return = 0)) ## # A tibble: 8 x 3 ## year qtr return ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2015 1 1.88 ## 2 2015 2 0.59 ## 3 2015 3 0.35 ## 4 2015 4 0 ## 5 2016 1 0 ## 6 2016 2 0.92 ## 7 2016 3 0.17 ## 8 2016 4 2.66 This specifies that we would like to replace any NA in the return column with 0. Again, if we had multiple columns with NAs, we could speficy for each column separately how to replace it. 5.3 Reading in data So far, we’ve used data sets that already came with the packages we’ve loaded. In the visualization chapters, we used the diamonds data set from the ggplot2 package, and in the data wrangling chapters, we used the starwars data set from the dplyr package. file type platform description csv general medium-size data frames RData R saving the results of intensive computations xls excel people who use excel json general more complex data structures feather python &amp; R fast interaction between R and python The foreign package helps with importing data that was saved in SPSS, Stata, or Minitab. For data in a json format, I highly recommend the tidyjson package. 5.3.1 csv I’ve stored some data files in the data/ subfolder. Let’s first read a csv (= comma-separated-value) file. df.csv = read_csv(&quot;data/movies.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## title = col_character(), ## genre = col_character(), ## director = col_character(), ## year = col_double(), ## duration = col_double(), ## gross = col_double(), ## budget = col_double(), ## cast_facebook_likes = col_double(), ## votes = col_double(), ## reviews = col_double(), ## rating = col_double() ## ) The read_csv() function gives us information about how each column was parsed. Here, we have some columns that are characters (such as title and genre), and some columns that are numeric (such as year and duration). Note that it says double() in the specification but double and numeric are identical. And let’s take a quick peek at the data: df.csv %&gt;% glimpse() ## Observations: 2,961 ## Variables: 11 ## $ title &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Over the Hill to the Poorhouse&quot;, &quot;The Broadway M… ## $ genre &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Crime&quot;, &quot;Musical&quot;, &quot;Comedy&quot;, &quot;Comedy&quot;, &quot;Comedy&quot;,… ## $ director &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Harry F. Millarde&quot;, &quot;Harry Beaumont&quot;, &quot;Lloyd Bac… ## $ year &lt;dbl&gt; 1920, 1929, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1939, 1… ## $ duration &lt;dbl&gt; 110, 100, 89, 81, 87, 83, 102, 226, 88, 144, 172,… ## $ gross &lt;dbl&gt; 3000000, 2808000, 2300000, 3000000, 163245, 18492… ## $ budget &lt;dbl&gt; 100000, 379000, 439000, 609000, 1500000, 2000000,… ## $ cast_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt; 4, 109, 995, 824, 352, 229, 2509, 1862, 1178, 203… ## $ votes &lt;dbl&gt; 5, 4546, 7921, 13269, 143086, 133348, 291875, 215… ## $ reviews &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 107, 162, 164, 331, 349, 746, 863, 252, 119, 3… ## $ rating &lt;dbl&gt; 4.8, 6.3, 7.7, 7.8, 8.6, 7.7, 8.1, 8.2, 7.5, 6.9,… The data frame contains a bunch of movies with information about their genre, director, rating, etc. The readr package (which contains the read_csv() function) has a number of other functions for reading data. Just type read_ in the console below and take a look at the suggestions that autocomplete offers. 5.3.2 RData RData is a data format native to R. Since this format can only be read by R, it’s not a good format for sharing data. However, it’s a useful format that allows us to flexibly save and load R objects. For example, consider that we always start our script by reading in and structuring data, and that this takes quite a while. One thing we can do is to save the output of intermediate steps as an RData object, and then simply load this object (instead of re-running the whole routine every time). We read (or load) an RData file in the following way: load(&quot;data/test.RData&quot;, verbose = TRUE) ## Loading objects: ## df.test I’ve set the verbose = argument to TRUE here so that the load() function tells me what objects it added to the environment. This is useful for checking whether existing objects were overwritten. 5.4 Saving data 5.4.1 csv To save a data frame as a csv file, we simply write: df.test = tibble(x = 1:3, y = c(&quot;test1&quot;, &quot;test2&quot;, &quot;test3&quot;)) write_csv(df.test, path = &quot;data/test.csv&quot;) Just like for reading in data, the readr package has a number of other functions for saving data. Just type write_ in the console below and take a look at the autocomplete suggestions. 5.4.2 RData To save objects as an RData file, we write: save(df.test, file = &quot;data/test.RData&quot;) We can add multiple objects simply by adding them at the beginning, like so: save(df.test, df.starwars, file = &quot;data/test_starwars.RData&quot;) 5.5 Additional resources 5.5.1 Cheatsheets wrangling data –&gt; wrangling data using dplyr and tidyr importing &amp; saving data –&gt; importing and saving data with readr 5.5.2 Data camp courses Joining tables writing functions importing data 1 importing data 2 categorical data dealing with missing data 5.5.3 Books and chapters Chapters 17-21 in R for Data Science Exploratory data analysis R programming for data science 5.5.4 Tutorials Joining data: Two-table verbs Tutorial by Jenny Bryan tidyexplain: Animations that illustrate how gather(), spread(), left_join(), etc. work 5.6 Session info ## R version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12) ## Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit) ## Running under: macOS Mojave 10.14.6 ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib ## LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib ## ## locale: ## [1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] forcats_0.4.0 stringr_1.4.0 dplyr_0.8.3 purrr_0.3.3 ## [5] readr_1.3.1 tidyr_1.0.0 tibble_2.1.3 ggplot2_3.2.1 ## [9] tidyverse_1.3.0 knitr_1.26 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] tidyselect_0.2.5 xfun_0.11 haven_2.2.0 lattice_0.20-38 ## [5] colorspace_1.4-1 vctrs_0.2.1 generics_0.0.2 htmltools_0.4.0 ## [9] yaml_2.2.0 utf8_1.1.4 rlang_0.4.2 pillar_1.4.3 ## [13] withr_2.1.2 glue_1.3.1 DBI_1.1.0 dbplyr_1.4.2 ## [17] modelr_0.1.5 readxl_1.3.1 lifecycle_0.1.0 munsell_0.5.0 ## [21] gtable_0.3.0 cellranger_1.1.0 rvest_0.3.5 evaluate_0.14 ## [25] fansi_0.4.0 highr_0.8 broom_0.5.3 Rcpp_1.0.3 ## [29] backports_1.1.5 scales_1.1.0 jsonlite_1.6 fs_1.3.1 ## [33] hms_0.5.2 digest_0.6.23 stringi_1.4.3 bookdown_0.16 ## [37] grid_3.6.2 cli_2.0.0 tools_3.6.2 magrittr_1.5 ## [41] lazyeval_0.2.2 crayon_1.3.4 pkgconfig_2.0.3 zeallot_0.1.0 ## [45] ellipsis_0.3.0 xml2_1.2.2 reprex_0.3.0 lubridate_1.7.4 ## [49] assertthat_0.2.1 rmarkdown_2.0 httr_1.4.1 rstudioapi_0.10 ## [53] R6_2.4.1 nlme_3.1-142 compiler_3.6.2 "]
